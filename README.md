1. Go to the project's GitHub page.
2. Click on the `Fork` button at the top right of the page to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.


## Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `REPOSITORY-NAME` with the name of the repository.






## Set Upstream Remote
Navigate to your repositoryâ€™s directory:
```bash
cd REPOSITORY-NAME
```

Add the original repository as a remote named `upstream`:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
```

Verify the new remote named `upstream`:
```bash
git remote -v
```

## Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Make Changes
Make your changes to the project using your preferred code editor. Follow the project's coding guidelines and ensure all changes are tested.

## Commit Changes
After making your changes, commit them with a descriptive message:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add your detailed description of changes"
```

## Push Changes
Push your changes to your forked repository:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Create a Pull Request
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the `Compare & pull request` button.

3. Ensure the base repository is the original repository, and the base branch is `main` (or `master`).
4. Add a title and description for your pull request.
5. Click `Create pull request`.

## Syncing with Upstream
To keep your forked repository up to date with the original repository, you need to sync it regularly:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```
